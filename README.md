# No-BS-JS
A repo for providing no bullshit examples of how to get things done in JS, projects you can make, etc. Everything will be heavily commented.

We won't use Bootstrap, jQuery, or anything similar. This is simply how to get things do in modern, pure JS.

At some point we may create additional versions for libraries like React, Vue, etc.
